# java-flooring-mastery-project

The goal of this mastery project is to create an application that can read and write flooring orders.

The application demonstrates my understanding of java software development, including:

  - N-tier/MVC architecture, including the use of a service layer
  - Interfaces
  - Spring dependency Injection
  - Unit Testing
